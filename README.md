# Carnegie Mellon University - Design Thinking Project
I opted for the course 'Design Thinking' during my time at Carnegie Mellon University.  We worked in a team of 4, to address a problem that students, career services staff and recruiters were facing at our school. We proceeded by using a 6-step approach to methodologically provide solutions to the problem.
